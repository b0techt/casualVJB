# Casual Two way transaction

Virtual Java Bank, made two years ago.
Which really is just a two way transaction where the user can withdraw and deposit "money" into an account.

Fully functional and completed, it creates a text file that consists of:
    >First name
    >
    >Surname
    >
    >Age
    >
    >Card Number
    >
    >Security Number
    >
    >PIN
    >
    >(Balance --> in a separate file)

Uses username to login, it's also the name of text file and will be seen in welcome message.

Fun little project that uses local files as storage for personal data.

No online database or anything of sort.
